## üöÄ Project Overview

This project utilizes a linear regression model to estimate mobile phone prices based on various features. The process includes:

- üìä **EDA**: Visual insights into relationships between features and price  
- üßπ **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data  
- üß† **Model Training**: Building and evaluating a linear regression model  
- üñ•Ô∏è **GUI**: A user-friendly Tkinter interface for inputting features and predicting prices  
- üìà **Visualizations**: Actual vs. predicted price plots and feature importance charts

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: **Mobile Price Prediction**. It contains:

- **161 rows**  
- **14 columns** (with `Price` as the target variable)

> üìå **Note**: The dataset (`Cellphone.csv`) is **not** included due to licensing constraints. Please download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and place it in the project directory.

## üîç Features

The model uses the following 13 features for prediction:

- `Product_id`: Unique identifier  
- `Sale`: Number of units sold  
- `Weight`: Weight in grams  
- `Resolution`: Screen resolution in inches  
- `PPI`: Pixels per inch  
- `CPU Core`: Number of CPU cores  
- `CPU Freq`: CPU frequency (GHz)  
- `Internal Mem`: Internal memory (GB)  
- `RAM`: RAM (GB)  
- `RearCam`: Rear camera resolution (MP)  
- `Front_Cam`: Front camera resolution (MP)  
- `Battery`: Battery capacity (mAh)  
- `Thickness`: Thickness in mm

---
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

## 1. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 2. Open and Run
- `Open mobile_price_predictor.ipnyb`
- `Run all cells to:`
 - `Perform EDA`
 - `Preprocess data`
 - `Train the model`
 - `Launch the Tkinter GUI`

## 3. Use the GUI
