## üöÄ Project Overview

This project utilizes a linear regression model to estimate mobile phone prices based on various features. The process includes:

- üìä **EDA**: Visual insights into relationships between features and price  
- üßπ **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data  
- üß† **Model Training**: Building and evaluating a linear regression model  
- üñ•Ô∏è **GUI**: A user-friendly Tkinter interface for inputting features and predicting prices  
- üìà **Visualizations**: Actual vs. predicted price plots and feature importance charts
